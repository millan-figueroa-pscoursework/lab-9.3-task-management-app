## Component Requirements

### 1. TaskList Component

[x] Create a TaskList component that manages and displays a list of tasks.

### 2. TaskItem Component

[ ] Create a TaskItem component that displays individual task information.

### 3. TaskFilter Component

[ ] Create a TaskFilter component that allows filtering tasks by status and priority.

## Activity Tasks

### Component Implementation:

Implement each component according to its interface requirements.

- [x] Use proper TypeScript types and interfaces.
- [x] Implement list rendering with unique keys.
- [ ] Add conditional rendering based on task properties.

### List Management:

- [x] Render the task list with proper key props.
- [ ] Implement filtering functionality.
- [x] Handle task status changes.
- [x] Implement task deletion.

### Visual Feedback:

- [ ] Show different styles based on task status and priority.
- [ ] Implement hover and active states.
- [ ] Add visual indicators for task properties.

### Component Composition:

- [ ] Compose components to create a complete task management interface.
- [ ] Handle prop passing between components.
- [x] Implement proper event handling.

## Optional: One Step Further

This is a self-guided challenge, and is entirely optional. <br>

If you’re looking for a challenge, try to implement the following. If you find yourself stuck, try again after lesson 8, which covers simple forms for user input.<br>

- [ ] Add a button to the TaskList component that sorts the tasks by due date.
- [ ] Add a button to the TaskList component that adds a new task to the list. This will require adding some type of form for the user to input the task details.
- [ ] Add buttons to the TaskItem component that allow the user to move the task up and down the list.

## Reflection Questions

#### How did you ensure unique keys for your list items?

#### What considerations did you make when implementing the filtering functionality?

#### How did you handle state updates for task status changes?

#### What challenges did you face when implementing conditional rendering?

## Submission

Submit your project via a GitHub repository using the Start Assignment link on Canvas. Your submission should include:

- [ ] All component implementations
- [ ] Example usage with documentation
- [ ] A README.md file explaining how to use the components
