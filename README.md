### Lab 9.3: Event Handling

# Lists, Keys, and Conditionals

## Lab Overview

In this lab, you will create a Task Management application that demonstrates dynamic list rendering, proper key usage, and conditional rendering. You will practice creating TypeScript React components that handle lists of data, implement filtering, and show different states based on task properties. This lab focuses on list rendering, key management, conditional rendering, and component composition using React and TypeScript.

## Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will:

- Create components that render lists of data with proper key management.
- Implement filtering and sorting of list items.
- Use conditional rendering to show different states based on item properties.
- Apply TypeScript interfaces for type safety.
- Implement proper component composition and prop handling.
